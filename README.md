# IRV Algorithm
An algorithm for [Instant Runoff Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting) elections.

### How to use
1. The algorithm assumes that all candidates are represented by a number. You should decide on what number represents who beforehand.
2.  Each ballot should be arranged in order of the voter's choice, then converted into the numbers mentioned earlier. For example, the image below would become "120". The ballots should then be put together with space separation, e.g. "120 210 102".

_NOTE: There's a mistake in this image. The first panel should go 3-1-2-blank. I'll fix this in a bit._
